## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Optimize Indexing

- **Exclude unnecessary files**: Add large generated files or dependencies to `.gitignore`
- **Focus on relevant languages**: Adjust `indexFileTypes` to match your project
- **Regular cleanup**: Run re-indexing after major refactoring

### 2. Better AI Responses

- **Be specific**: "How does the UserService authenticate users?" vs "How does auth work?"
- **Provide context**: Select relevant code before asking questions
- **Iterate**: Ask follow-up questions for deeper understanding

### 3. Effective Code Search

- **Use descriptive queries**: "database connection pooling" vs "db"
- **Think conceptually**: Search for what the code does, not exact names
- **Combine with navigation**: Use results as starting points for exploration

### 4. Architecture Best Practices

- **Regular analysis**: Run architecture analysis weekly/monthly
- **Track improvements**: Save reports to track progress
- **Focus on violations**: Address layer violations first

### 5. Refactoring Workflow

1. Start with high-priority suggestions
2. Make one change at a time
3. Run tests after each refactoring
4. Re-analyze to verify improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Activating

**Problem**: CodeMemory commands not available

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have an open workspace
- Check VS Code version (‚â•1.74.0)
- Look for errors in Output ‚Üí CodeMemory

### Indexing Issues

**Problem**: Indexing fails or takes too long

**Solutions**:
- Check available disk space
- Exclude large files/directories
- Reduce number of file types indexed
- Try manual indexing with smaller file set

### AI Features Not Working

**Problem**: "LLM not configured" error

**Solutions**:
1. Verify API key is set correctly
2. Check API key permissions/credits
3. Ensure internet connection
4. Try switching providers

### Memory/Performance Issues

**Problem**: VS Code becomes slow

**Solutions**:
- Clear index: Delete `.codememory` folder
- Reduce indexed file types
- Disable auto-indexing for large projects
- Close unused webview panels

### Search Not Finding Expected Results

**Problem**: Relevant code not appearing in search

**Solutions**:
- Ensure files are indexed (check status)
- Try different query terms
- Verify file type is in `indexFileTypes`
- Re-index the workspace

## FAQ

### Q: Is my code sent to the cloud?

**A**: Only when using AI features (explanation, questions). The vector index is stored locally. You can use search features completely offline.

### Q: How much disk space does CodeMemory use?

**A**: Typically 50-200MB for medium projects. The `.codememory` folder in your workspace contains all data.

### Q: Can I use CodeMemory without an API key?

**A**: Yes! Code search and basic analysis work offline. Only AI-powered explanations and questions require an API key.

### Q: Does CodeMemory work with all programming languages?

**A**: CodeMemory has optimized parsers for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Java. Other languages are supported with basic parsing.

### Q: How often should I re-index?

**A**: CodeMemory auto-updates its index. Manual re-indexing is only needed after major structural changes or if you suspect index corruption.

### Q: Can I share my index with team members?

**A**: The `.codememory` folder can be shared, but it's better for each developer to build their own index for optimal performance.

### Q: What's the difference between OpenAI and Anthropic providers?

**A**: Both offer similar capabilities. OpenAI typically has faster response times, while Anthropic (Claude) often provides more detailed explanations.

### Q: How can I improve the quality of AI responses?

**A**: 
1. Ensure your code has good comments/documentation
2. Use descriptive variable/function names
3. Select relevant context before asking questions
4. Be specific in your queries

### Q: Is CodeMemory open source?

**A**: Yes! Contribute at [github.com/vikasj2in/codememory-vscode](https://github.com/vikasj2in/codememory-vscode)
