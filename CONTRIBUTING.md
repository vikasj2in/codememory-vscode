## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- VSCode (for testing the extension)
- Git

### Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikasj2in/codememory-vscode.git
   cd codememory-vscode
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Open in VSCode:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. Run the extension in development:
   - Press `F5` to launch a new VSCode window with the extension loaded
   - Make changes and reload the window to test

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Test the extension manually
# Press F5 in VSCode
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow conventional commit format:
```
feat: add new parser for Ruby files
fix: resolve memory leak in vector store
docs: update API documentation
chore: upgrade dependencies
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

- Push your branch to your fork
- Create a PR against the main branch
- Fill out the PR template
- Wait for review

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Adding a New LLM Provider

1. Create a new provider class extending `LLMProvider`:
   ```typescript
   export class YourProvider extends LLMProvider {
     async generateResponse(prompt: string, context?: string): Promise<string> {
       // Implementation
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add to `LLMInterface` constructor switch statement

3. Update configuration schema in `package.json`

4. Add documentation for configuration

### Performance Considerations

- Batch operations when possible
- Use streaming for large files
- Implement proper caching
- Monitor memory usage

## üìã Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% coverage

### Integration Tests

- Test component interactions
- Use real file samples
- Test error scenarios

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Extension activates without errors
- [ ] Indexing completes successfully
- [ ] Commands work as expected
- [ ] Memory persists across sessions
- [ ] Error messages are helpful

```anguage Parser

1. Create a new parser class extending `LanguageParser`:
   ```typescript
   class RubyParser extends LanguageParser {
     async parse(document: vscode.TextDocument): Promise<CodeChunk[]> {
       // Implementation
     }
   }
   ```

2. Register in `CodeParser.initializeParsers()`

3. Add file extension to default settings

4. Add tests for the parser
